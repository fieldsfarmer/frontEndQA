#### map
- data structure for std::map. It is usually implemented on the basis of an ordered tree, for example red-black-tree in STL's case.
- std::map is a sorted associative container that contains key-value pairs with unique keys. Keys are sorted by using the comparison function Compare. Search, removal, and insertion operations have logarithmic complexity. Maps are usually implemented as red-black trees

#### misc
- auto variable initializer, since C++11
