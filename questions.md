> 1. What is MVC?

Model: managing data; Controller: application logic; View: presenting data

> 2. GET vs POST?

GET: retrieve representations of resources; no side effects; no data in request body. 
POST: upload data from the browser to server; returns information from the server; side effects are likely; data contained in the request body.
